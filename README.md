# JS Open Redirector

`This does nothing other than redirecting to other page if location specified.`
### Documentation:

`Just replace ' <url> ' in http://maximousblk.github.io/redirect/#/\<url> with destination URL and this will redirect to the destination and will remove referrer too.`
### Limits
`I have blocked this to redirect only to http and https protocol.`

`Requires JS, client side.`

### But why?

`I made this just to bypass a specific API and open it for everything (was blocked for some specific things). Hosted this on GitHub because it's easy and fast that way. Now, everyone can use this for anything they want. Now it's your chice what to use it for. `

`Well, that's it. Simple.`
